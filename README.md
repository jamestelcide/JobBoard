# JobBoard

A full-stack web application designed to show off my skills in implementing a RESTful service. Users can view, add, edit and delete job postings after creating an account and logging in.

# Features
* View, Create, Update, Delete job listings.
* Search job listings by city and state.
* Secure user access with JWT authentication.
* Integrated Swagger for simple testing and documentation for API endpoints.

# Technologies Used
Frontend
* React: Built reusable components with state management using useState and lifecycle management with useEffect.
* React Router: Implemented navigation between pages for a seamless user experience.
* Axios: Used for making asynchronous HTTP requests to the REST API.
* TypeScript: Enforced static typing for props, state, and functions to improve code quality and reduce runtime errors.
* Vite: Leveraged Vite's fast development server to optimize the build process.
Backend
* ASP.NET Core 8 Web API: Developed robust and scalable endpoints for managing job listings and loging into the application.
* Entity Framework Core: Set up and managed a SQL Server database with migrations.
* JWT Authentication: Secured API endpoints with token-based authentication.
* xUnit: Wrote unit tests to ensure reliability of the Web API logic.
* Swagger: Integrated API documentation to test endpoints directly from a user-friendly interface.

# Getting Started
Prerequisites
* .NET 8 SDK installed
* SQL Server set up with a new database called 'JobListingDatabase'
